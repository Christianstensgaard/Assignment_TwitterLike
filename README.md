# Documentation overview
All tasks within the system are organized in the docs folder. Each task is named according to its respective week, and all related information can be found there.

This README serves as a front page to guide readers in the right direction.

Additionally, I have included:

* Draw.io diagrams for visual representation.
* Project conclusions summarizing the outcomes of the project.
* An architecture overview located at the bottom of this document.


## Important
I’ve been experimenting with different approaches before receiving feedback on the last assignment. As a result, I spent a lot of time trying to explain my thought process for each topic in the assignment.

After receiving the feedback, I attempted to implement some of the techniques introduced in class, such as Ocelot. However, I struggled to make it work seamlessly with my system. Ultimately, I wouldn’t have chosen it for my system architecture, but I included it to demonstrate the use of classroom technologies. Unfortunately, this caused some system components to break completely.

In the end, I hope my efforts to organize the task information help make this submission a bit less messy and easier for you to follow.
