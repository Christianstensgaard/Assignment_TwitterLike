# Conclusion
I have been working on a project for the second time, first where I tried to create everything from scratch. But after the first feedback, I stopped creating all by myself and started to use some of the different technologies used in the classroom.
After the last feedback, there are still things I could make better, but given the time of feedback and the state of the project, changing them would be a major task in itself. Therefore, I chose not to make changes for this project.
Reflecting on the Assignment, I’ve been touching up all parts of the tasks, where some are a bit trickier doing the way, I designed to system. One of them is the API-gateway that I tried to use Ocelot but failed. I tried to make a separate application that call another API, with the different routes, to simulate the use of ocelot, but this made the general system fogy, and a lot harder to follow and understand.
In the end, I think this has been a success, I’ve been around all the topics, and played around with them, and now I have a general understanding of how they work, and if I should make this again, I would have done it differently.
